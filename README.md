# google-trends-graphs

Data visualization script and functions for Google trends dataset. 

## Motivation of the project
This code has been written for a reserach project at my company. The graphs are designed according to E. Tufte guidelines to 
beautiful and effective data visualisation. 

## Input/Output
The scripts reads Google Trends data from a folder data/raw and writes the outcomes to report/figures_report. 
You should create (and populate with data) those two folders in the project path should you want to use the main script (src/create_report_graphs.py).
